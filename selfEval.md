# Self-Evaluation

1. This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
- I felt a little overwhelmed espeically when it came time to google things I didn't know. Google is a huge melting pot and it took time to find resources that were helpful that I could understand.

2. How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
- I think its going good but I need to get better at telling myself to take a break or stop for the day. Even when I am not necessarily unproductive struggling, sometimes I just want to learn as much as I can and go down rabbbit hole after rabbit hole of information.

3. What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
- I want to remember to always check my work after I write a piece of code because I kept forgetting to check and then when I wrote a bunch of code and went to check in terminal and got an error, it was hard to pinpoint which piece of code from which exercise was wrong so I feel like if I get into the habit of always checking it would be very useful.
